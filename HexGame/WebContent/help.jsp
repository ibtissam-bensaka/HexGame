<h1>HEX GAME</h1>
<p>
	  Hex is a board game for two players. It was
      <br />independently invented by Piet Hein in 1942
      <br />and John Nash in 1948 and became popular
      <br />after 1950 under the name Hex.
      <br />Hex is most commonly played on a board with
      <br />11x11 cells, but it can also be played on a
      <br />board of another size. The red player trys
      <br />to connect the two red borders with a chain
      <br />of red cells by coloring empty cells red,
      <br />while the blue player trys the same with the
      <br />blue borders.
      <br />The game can never end with a draw:
      <br />When all cells have been colored, there must
      <br />exists either a red chain or a blue chain.
      <br />The player who moves first has a big advantage.
      <br />Good luck!"
